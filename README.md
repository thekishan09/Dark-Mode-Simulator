# Dark Mode Simulator

```
I built a user-friendly email composer Express.js and React.js where users can craft emails from scratch or use pre-made templates. It integrates with email services for sending, and offers a dynamic preview with dark and light modes (styled with CSS/Material-UI). This feature is backed by Express APIs for easy template management.
